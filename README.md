JavaScript Map Lab
---

## Objectives

1. Practice implementing a `map()` function
2. Practice using `map()`

## Introduction

- As with the `reduce()` lab, remind students how they got to this point (https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/javascript-map)

- Frame the lab with a specific, real-world-seeming problem (this could be forward looking to playing with data from an API (just store it locally somewhere -- make sure it's not huge)

## Implementation

- As with the `reduce()` lab, be sure to test students' implementations for failure cases as well as successes
- Be sure, too, to test how they use the function

## Resources

- [MDN: Array.prototype.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
